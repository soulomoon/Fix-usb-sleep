Fix "Disk not ejected properly" Issue on OS X/Mac OS X
============

Hola, this is an ongoing project aims at fixing the issue of disk not ejected properly upon sleep. This issue has a really long history since Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9) even on a real Mac. Without the help of Bernhard Baehr (bernhard.baehr@gmx.de)'s great sleepwatcher daemon, this project will not be created. 

I've tested on my DELL Precision M3800. Wish you all enjoy it. Any feedback is welcomed! 

How to use fixUSB.sh?
----------------
Download the latest `fixUSB.sh` by entering the following command in a terminal window:

``` sh
curl -o ./fixUSB.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulomoon/Fix-usb-sleep/master/fixUSB.sh
```


This will download `fixUSB.sh` to your current directory (`./`) and the next step is to change the permissions of the file (add `+x`) so that it can be run.
 
``` sh
chmod +x ./fixUSB.sh
```


Run the script in a terminal window by:

``` sh
./fixusb.sh
```

Once you finish the procedures, sleep your OS X and see if the issue is fixed.


If you do not want to use `fixusb.sh` in the future, then uninstall it by entering:
``` sh
./fixusb.sh -u
```


Use `-d` argument to see the details of the whole progress.

How to use ramdisk?
----------------
Download the latest ramdisk by entering the following command in a terminal window:

``` sh
curl -o ./ramdisk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscl/Fix-usb-sleep/master/ramdisk.sh
```

This will download ramdisk to your current directory (`./`) and the next step is to change the permissions of the file (add `+x`) so that it can be run.

``` sh
chmod +x ./ramdisk
```

Run the script in a terminal window by:

``` sh
./ramdisk
```
Reboot your OS X to see the change. If you have any problem about the script, try to run deploy in DEBUG mode by
```sh
./ramdisk -d
```
or
```sh
./ramdisk -debug
```
